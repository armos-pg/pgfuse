Coding guidelines
-----------------

  8-character TABs.
    
  Standard C89, portable to all platforms supporting FUSE (Linux,
  FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Darwin/MacOSX). No C++, no C99.
    
  Do not introduce unnecessary 3rd party dependencies in addition
  to the required 'libfuse' and 'libpq'.
    
  Use native 'libpq', not abstractions. The database operations
  are simple enough. If possible avoid string manipulations as
  for timestamps (we are on low-level OS-abstraction layer, so
  'struct timespec' and epochs are fine).
          
Design desicions
----------------

Storage of binary data
----------------------

Options:

One ByteA field

  All data in a big bytea column: needs memory of the size of the
  complete file on client (pgfuse) and server (PostgreSQL) side,
  is ok for small files (first proof-of-concept implementation)

Multiple ByteA of equal size

  As in Mysqlfs simulate blocks as bytea fields of fixes size with
  a block number. The blocksize has to be carefully tuned with file-
  system, PostgreSQL and fuse parameters.
  
  Should give good average performance, the "One ByteA field" variant
  for small files is still as efficient as before.

Blobs

  They are streamable, but we lack some security (verify?) and we
  lack referential integrity.
  
  The functions to manipulate the blobs are not so nice.
  
  It's also questionable whether they could be faster than a bytea.

Some unsorted thoughts:

Streams are mere abstractions and not really needed from the database
interface.

COPY FROM and COPY to as a fast, non-transactional mode?

Directory tree in database
--------------------------

Naive implementation
  
  Complete path as string. Has high mutation costs for renames,
  storage overhead. But is very fast for queries (no joins).
  
TODO...

Self-containment
----------------

React decently to loose of database connections. Try to reestablish
the connection, the loss of database connection could be temporary.

What should be reported back as temporary error state to FUSE?
EIO seems a good option (as if the disk would have temporary I/O
problems).
