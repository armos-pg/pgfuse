Note for Packagers
------------------

The SPEC file in 'redhat' and the files in 'debian' are
for the OpenSuse Build service. They can serve as template
for your own packaging. Feedback on erros is highly welcome.

For Archlinux I maintain my own package at

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=58648

Please drop a note there if you have troubles with the
packages, don't fork your own ones!
