- pooling of PQconn
- thread-synchronization
- handling of most file system metadata
- efficient partial writes of bytea
- use of asynchonous read/writes
- what is a transaction? couple to fsync/fdatasync
  for files? other ideas? customizable?
- how to store binary data? bytea or BLOBs? is
  there a way to implement streams (append to
  file, or sequential read) efficient together
  with random access? db securityy on blobs?
  Use COPY TO/COPY FROM?
- establish self-containment (with respect to
  a temporarily unavailable Postgresql server)
- minimal SELinux support, i.e. one fix context
  per mount point
