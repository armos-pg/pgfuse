- pooling of PQconn
- thread-synchronization
- handling of most file system metadata
  - ownership: how is this done depending on
    per-user or root mounts? think about security
    here!
  - mode: simple
  - times: simple
  - extended attributes
- use of asynchonous read/writes
- what is a transaction? couple to fsync/fdatasync
  for files? other ideas? customizable?
- how to store binary data? 
  - bytea complete: needs memory on client and server,
    ok for small files
  - split bytea (in blocks, as mysqlfs): should give
    good average performance
  - BLOBs: streamable, no referencial integrity though,
    have a weak security model
  => most likely a split bytea with tunable blocksize
    (with a small block cache on the side of pgfuse
    is the way to go) 
- is there a way to implement streams (append to
  file, or sequential read) efficient together
  with random access? Use COPY TO/COPY FROM?
  => most likely not worth the hazzle. Most streams
  (but for BLOBS) are mere abstractions in the
  database binding of the programming language
  => sticking to traditional libpq C way
- use prepared statements, measure performance gain
- establish self-containment (with respect to
  a temporarily unavailable Postgresql server)
- minimal SELinux support, i.e. one fix security context
  per mount point
  unique: 8, opcode: GETXATTR (22), nodeid: 7, insize: 68
  unique: 8, error: -38 (Function not implemented), outsize: 16
  lsetxattr("file.sgml", "security.selinux", "system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0", 41, 0) = -1 EOPNOTSUPP (Operation not supported)
- investigate SELinux races
- make some performance tests, see http://archive09.linux.com/feature/127055
